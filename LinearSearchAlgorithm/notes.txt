1. Q: arr = [18, 12, 9, 14, 77, 50]. Find wheter 14 exists in array or not?
S: using 'for each' loop
N: If value is find then it will return index value else it will return -1.
E: Lineear Search Algorithm say say for the first element of array and
    scans the array until it finds the element we are looking for or the entire array is scaned.
    Each for the elements in the array in linear way that index to '0' to 'n-1'.
TC: best case => O(1)   // constant
    worst case => O(n)

2. Q: How many checks or comparsions will the loop make in 'best' case i.e. element found at 0th index?
A:[
    arr = [8, 9, 12, 18, ..... 200 elements]
    target = 8
    Only 1 comparsion in best case
    Now, n = 1 lakh
    arr = [18, 12, 9, 7, ...... 1 lakh elements]
    target = 18
    Only 1 comparsion in best case

3. Q: How many checks or comparsions will the loop make in 'worst' case i.e. element found at 0th index?
A: [
    You do not find the target item.
    Iterate through each and every element in the array and in the end it says i did not find it.
    n = 100 => 100 comparsions => 100 ms
    n = 200 => 200 comparsions => 200 ms
    n = 1 lakh  => 1 lakh comparsions => 100000 ms => 100 seconds

4. Q: arr = [18, 12, -7, 3, 14, 28]. Search for 3 in the range of index [1, 4]?
A: [
    N: read from {SearchInRange.java} file
